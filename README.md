### Basic Information from the Author
### This repository was created specifically to host a final paper for a Data Science Practicum II course at Regis University in Denver, Colorado. The file "Final Documentation.md" contains the full paper with details on the project from beginning to end. The project was completed on an eight-week timeframe, and it used Python programming language in pandas with Jupyter notebook to clean up the data, analyze the data, and create the best model to recommend to the company. The projectâ€™s final product goal was to analyze the data to help the bank to identify the key factors determining the probability of credit card default.
